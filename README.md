For this project, we are creating a database where we can assign each person in the company with their role and skills. Each employee has an employee ID, a name, an email address, a LinkedIn URL, a headshot, discord handle, a brief bio, and the date that they joined the company. Each role has a role_id, a role name and a sort ID. Each skill should have an ID, a name, a description, and a URL pointing to where customers can learn more about the credential. 

I provided a document whcih includes a crows foot diagram for the database that was created, and provides with varous sample queries that can be performed on the database along with their result outputs. It also shows the various tables in the database such as roles, skills, and people tables.
